    <h2>My Blog:</h2>
    <p>I learned about a program called Career Choice that Amazon offers not too long ago. I would always see these little ads on YouTube where Amazon employees where sitting around talking about how they tripled their salary by going through this training that they went through provided by Amazon and it always piqued my interest. So, one day I decided to actively seek out information on what exactly I could do to improve my future as well. I went through the process of applying to, being accepted, and ultimately enrolling in a program and now, hopefully I'm on my way to achieving many goals I have for myself. I am just starting my journey to become a web developer and so far it's been quite challenging. The subject matter is very often difficult to process and understand, but I'm determined and will do whatever it takes to get through and make it until the end of the program to ensure a better future for myself and my family. </p>
